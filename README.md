# Udacity Front-End Web Development Nanodegree: P5-Neighbourhood Map

In this project we had to make a google map application that uses the google map api as well as a third party api to display locations of your neighbourhood on a map as well as some information about those locations.


## Instructions:
To view the Neighbourhood Map app download all the files and open index.html in your browser.

##Description:
This app features a map of Juhu, Mumbai with markers on some of the best restaurants in Juhu. Using a search bar to filter these locations, an infowindow displays content about each location using the Foursquare api.
